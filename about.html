        <br />
        <h4>A company you can trust!</h4>
        <p>Since our beginning in the 1990&rsquo;s, C and C Tours has taken thousands of students on tours. We know that there is no tool more powerful than seeing your classroom come to life in the real world. That&rsquo;s why we strive to provide unique learning opportunities that meet your specific educational goals, making each of our programs the educational experience of a lifetime for your students.</p>
        <h4>Start to finish, our team will be here for you</h4>
        <p>From the dynamic team that makes up our staff, to our talented and dedicated Tour Managers, the C and C Family is a tight-knit group of people with far-reaching connections working together to create one-of-a-kind educational programs.</p>
        <p>We know how important a successful trip is to you. Your group has high expectations and you want them to walk away with a smile, a sense of fulfillment and reward. Let our experts do the planning for you!</p>
        <p>One of our knowledgeable Tour Consultants that specializes in your destination will work with you from your first call until the day of departure. They will be available to customize your itinerary, answer your questions, provide guidance and listen to your feedback. On your trip you will always have 24 hour access to our emergency phone number where a representative will be able to answer any questions that arise. And of course you will have an engaging Tour Manager during your trip to guide you through your journey.</p>
        <h4>Organizing your group made simple</h4>
        <p>Our job is to take the weight of planning a trip off your shoulders! We will provide you with information about the trip to share with your students and their parents. We will send you a customized flyer outlining the itinerary and trip details. We can also provide a PowerPoint picture slide show if needed.</p>
        <p>We will customize a webpage specifically for your group that will allow students to sign up and pay for their trip online! As the lead contact for the trip, you may access the information online at any time. We also offer payment plan options for people who want to make a series of payments rather than a deposit and then one large balance.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Why Choose C and C Tours?</h3>
        <br />
        <h4>Customization</h4>
        <p>Our experienced team will customize a program to suit your needs. Our professional Tour Consultants will help set up an itinerary that will complement the classroom experience by incorporating elements of your curriculum into the tour. You tell us your vision for the program, and we will do the rest! Whether you know exactly what you are looking for in a program or are interested in new ideas and suggestions, our aim is to make sure that your program meets your specific educational goals.</p>
        <h4>Safety</h4>
        <p>Your safety is our first priority from conception to completion of each program. We understand that safety and risk management are year-round tasks that require ongoing learning, improving and adjusting. For this reason, we begin with meticulously planned programs and detailed emergency plans, while continuously evaluating our policies, procedures and protocols.</p>
        <h4>Experienced Tour Managers</h4>
        <p>Tour Managers are vital to the integrity and safety of our programs. Accompanying each group is a dedicated Tour Manager who has been carefully selected for his/her experience working with students, responsibility, organization, language skills, knowledge of the destination, flexibility and sense of humor. Our Tour Managers are well-traveled, enthusiastic and love sharing their life experiences to create the best possible program for students.</p>
        <p>They will be with you throughout the entire tour and will take care of all included sightseeing, activities, accommodations, transportation and meals. This allows you to focus on the students and enjoy the tour without worrying about logistics.</p>
        <h4>Chaperones Travel Free</h4>
        <p>No matter how many students go on your trip, you want to go too!</p>
        <h4>Private Tours</h4>
        <p>All of our tours are private. The trip is tailored to the needs and interests of you and your school. We only combine groups at the request of the school.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>C and C Tours, Your Partner in Travel</h3>
        <p>We understand that planning a trip can be difficult and many people still have concerns coming out of the pandemic. C and C Tours has never been more prepared to ease your worries and put the fun back in travel planning!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We know no trip is one size fits all. We will work with you to create an itinerary that is perfect for your specific group of students.</li>
        <li>Flexibility is the name of the game! As COVID policies change, we will adjust and make sure your students have the best experience possible.</li>
        <li>We offer online payment options and can include cancelation insurance in the overall trip cost that will ensure a 75% refund for cancelations for any reason.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>PLAN NOW</strong></p>
        <p>We want planning your trip to be as stress-free as possible. We'll work with you to plan your itinerary and reserve everything for your trip. We know that things may change and our new policies allow for maximum flexibility so we can make adjustments as your travel date approaches.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>AND PAY LATER</strong></p>
        <p>Our new policies include flexibility with deposits and payments. There are no fees to modify travel dates or your destination as long as changes are made far enough in advance. Travelers can begin making deposits and payments when your group is ready. We know some groups want to get started early and have smaller monthly payments while others would like to wait until closer to the trip date. We will work with you to come up with the best schedule for your group.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>FULL REFUND</strong><strong><br /> </strong>Take advantage of our flexible refund policy in the event your entire group needs to cancel. If federal or state government restrictions prevent your trip from running and cancellation occurs at least 90 days prior to your trip, everyone will receive a full refund. Trip cancellation insurance can be included automatically for everyone or can be purchased on an individual basis. Insurance greatly increases refund amounts for cancellations less than 90 days before the trip date. More details about trip cancellation insurance can be found <a href="https://www.insureyonder.com/group-insurance/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwz7uRBhDRARIsAFqjulkSKkB5A9gtOCQ81X73uFvrfhMWvqyqMmBmVQ89RBTLo21dAGkqCtoaAvIPEALw_wcB">HERE.</a></p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>STAYING HEALTHY ON TOUR</strong><strong><br /> </strong>The health and safety of your group remains our top priority! We will be following and adjusting to guidelines from the CDC and complying with all state and federal government safety protocols as well as coordinating with our vendors to maintain as safe an environment as possible. We will remind everyone on the trip to stay home if they are sick and wear masks when required. We will also work with you to support your school&rsquo;s individual health and safety efforts.</p>
